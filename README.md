# Relaxed Recentered Log-Barrier function based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control

This repository contains the code for the paper Relaxed Recentered Log-Barrier function based Nonlinear Model 
Predictive Control submitted to the European Control Conference 2023.

The numerical experiments were implemented using the [acados](https://github.com/acados/acados) library
and the code is easily extensible to other systems than the CSTR system (dealt with in the [paper itself](ECC_RRLB_NMPC.pdf)).
